## Business Value Proposition

This exhibit allows new and veteran World of Warcraft players to enjoy
competitive gameplay together at BlizzCon. This generates hype for the
historic [Arena World Championship](https://raider.io/tournaments/awc)
and the perpetual, fierce competition on live servers.

The objective of this exhibit is to increase the player population that
participates in player-versus-player gameplay on live servers,
and stimulate the competitive World of Warcraft economy by demonstrating
the thrill of competitive gaming in a live environment.

Certain implementation details of the exhibit, such as the use of USB GamePad
controllers, bring awareness to more ergonomic options for competitive play.

## Technological Feasibility and Event Integration

This exhibit requires 120 VAC power for various computers, screens and possible
audio amplification. This exhibit also requires greater internet access / the
ability to play World of Warcraft on live servers for each game station.

Accounts with character loadouts are provided by Libre Embedded such that each
station may be configured to play most specializations available to "damage"
and "healer" roles. Control schemes and character configurations are
vetted for competitive viability on live servers before being made available to
play at the exhibit, ensuring a positive gameplay experience.

Players enjoying the exhibit may only control the World of Warcraft game client
while participating in a live match. Upon match completion, client controls
are de-energized while the upcoming match is being prepared, and controls
remain de-energized until new players enter the starting room for the new
match. This limits the gameplay demonstration to Solo Shuffle arena matches
and not other gameplay.

We believe this exhibit architecture complies in good faith with the
[BLIZZARD END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement)
and recognize that formal authorization (per 1.C iii and iv, "esports")
is required for this use case.
