## Anecdote

We at Libre Embedded believe that World of Warcraft player-versus-player
gameplay constitutes honorable team combat that can achieve cultural
significance just as combat sports such as hockey or American football have
worldwide.

We intend to pursue and contribute to this cultural transformation at the
discretion of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and in compliance with the
[BLIZZARD END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement).

We intend to do so through primarily via technological product contributions,
such as this exhibit, and/or volunteer contributions to competitive World of
Warcraft live events and experiences.
