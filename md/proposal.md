# Dalaran Sewers

*A BlizzCon 2026 World of Warcraft Exhibit Proposal by
[Libre Embedded](https://www.libre-embedded.com/)*

## Brief

Exhibitors form two queues, one for each combat role, to participate in
player-versus-player combat gameplay in World of Warcraft (via non-ladder war
game matches). Exhibitors waiting in queue (and nearby the exhibit) enjoy live
broadcasting of the matches being played.
